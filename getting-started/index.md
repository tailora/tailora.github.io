# Getting Started

## What is Tailora?

Tailora is a Laravel application scaffolding that is an ideal foundation for your next Laravel project. With Tailora,
you get a comprehensive package including login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session
management, API support through [Laravel Sanctum](https://github.com/laravel/sanctum), and the optional team management
module.

Tailora is designed using [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and
uses [Inertia Js](https://inertiajs.com/).

Tailora is heavily inspired by [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/) and most of the code is borrowed from
there.
